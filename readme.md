# MyCalm

I have always been a meditation enthusiast and wanted to make an application for people to do meditation without any problem in this life.

## Main features
1. Breathing Exercise
2. Ambient Music and stories for sleep
3. Meditation Journal


### 1. Breathing Exercise
- Breathing exercise has only three parts **Holding**, **Inhaling**, and **Exhaling**. 
- Timer will need to show for how much each action is done. 
- I am thinking of creating a function that will take the configuration for the these three values and will create a simple breathing timer.
- I will also make sure that I develop more features like how to make it better for everybody and adding a circle to show the whole cycle so that user can tell things apart.

### 2. Ambient Music player
- I want to add songs or music for making people feel calm it would offer a large variety of music for any kind of version
- I also want to it to play on loop.
- it would also have some sleep stories option.

### 3. Meditation Journal
- a place to store the meditation thoughts and anything user want.
- it will be a simple crud based application.

## Extra features
- background music
- daily reminder
- streak reminder
- goal setting
- meditation instruction and some reading
- documentation
